Assuming you want to redo the port from scratch by directly loading the original Squeak Monticello files you from www.squeaksource.com the following class definitions have to be executed manually in a Workspace before the loading.



    Object subclass: #ExternalType

    instanceVariableNames: 'compiledSpec referentClass referencedType'

    classVariableNames: 'AtomicSelectors AtomicTypeNames AtomicTypes StructTypes'
	    poolDictionaries: 'FFIConstants'

    category: 'FFI-Kernel'.

    ByteArray variableByteSubclass: #ExternalAddress
	
    instanceVariableNames: ''
	
    classVariableNames: ''

    poolDictionaries: ''
	
    category: 'FFI-Kernel'.

    Object subclass: #ExternalObject
	
    instanceVariableNames: 'handle'

    classVariableNames: ''

    poolDictionaries: ''
	
    category: 'FFI-Kernel'.
	
	

Afterwards do


    ExternalObject subclass: #ExternalFunction

    instanceVariableNames: 'flags argTypes'
	
    classVariableNames: 'FFIErrorMessages'

    poolDictionaries: ''

    category: 'FFI-Kernel'.


And


    ExternalStructure
